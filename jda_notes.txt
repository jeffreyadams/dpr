J: page 1: eds looks plural

T: Not sure how to improve this.

J: introduction: the tense varies between "Shelstad defines" and "Shelstad defined". I'll leave it up to you to decide if this is an issue.

T: Ok, took care of it.

J: I'm of the opinion that it is fine to split infinitives, and one should when this sounds better.

T: I don't understand what this means. You are welcome to make any language changes you see fit.

J: bottom of page 4: Vogan introduced "pure inner forms" in [Vog93] - this is the p-adic case, as mentioned R was already in ABV. I added the phrase "for general fields". This isn't important, get rid of it if you want.

T: Thanks for pointing that out. I have kept it and slightly expanded this paragraph.

J: I seem to remember that at some point you defined rigid inner forms using the condition that something be in the center of the derived group, and this restricted notion still maps onto all rational forms. Here we're using all of Z (which seems better to me). Do I have that right?

T: Yes, the center of the derived subgroup is sufficient, and this is important for global applications. In the purely local setting it is a bit more natural to use the center of the entire group.

J: Thank anyone besides Eric Opdam?

T: Not sure, but thanking him is a great idea.


J: Definition 2.7.2. I'm afraid I have to object to 1. In the literature "Discrete Series" means: embeds in L^2(G), or equivalently all matrix coefficients are in L^2. I believe this is due to Godemont. A good reference is "Wolf, Representations on Partially Holomorphic Cohomology Spaces, in Representation theory and harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces, AMS Contemporary Math 714." According to that reference what is in 1 is precisely "relative discrete series" - note that the central character is unitary. 

T: Thanks, I have incorporated that.

J: A natural condition on an irreducible representation is: matrix coefficients are square integrable modulo the center. Such a representation has a central character, not necessarily unitary. Does such a representation satisfy your definition 2? This comes down to: can we find a character \chi of G so that \pi\otimes\chi has unitary central character? I think this is true but I'm not sure.

T: I don't know what it means for the matrix coefficients to be square-integrable modulo the center if the central character is not unitary. I have tried to give an equivalent formulation (as a new Lemma) that seems close to what you are saying. Have a look and tell me what you think. I have asked there for you to provide references for two well-known facts.

J: Theorem 2.7.4: I think you need to say "among irreducible tempered representations". For example in SO(2,1) the spherical principal series at rho is the sum (in the Grothendieck group) of the trivial representation and the unique discrete series. So on the compact torus these have the same formula up to sign; probably you can find a similar example where they agree exactly.

T: It looks like you have corrected this, thank you.


J: Theorem 2.9.1: $\O(\delta,f)$ appears in 1, presumably this should be $\O_\delta(f)$.

T: It seems you have corrected this, thank you.

J: second paragraph of 2.11: "connected semi-simple algebraic" not "connected semisimple simply connected algebraic?

T: No, it does need to be simply connected (algebraically), otherwise it's R-points will not be connected in general.

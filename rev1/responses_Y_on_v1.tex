(1) I don't understand this comment. If the question is about the uniqueness of Shelstad's first construction of the transfer factor, then the answer is that it is unique up to multiplication by -1, i.e. the pair of functions {\Delta,-\Delta} is unique.

(2) No. $\bar z_\sigma$ denotes the value of the 1-cocycle $\bar z$ at $\sigma$, which is what is needed.


(6) I do not understand this comment. The claim is that there is a natural bijection between two sets -- the set of $\hat T$-conjugacy classes of $L$-homomorphisms $W_\R \to {^LT}_\pm$, and the set of genuine characters of $T(\R)_\pm$.

(23) The explanation is just about the notation. The proof of the formula is not given there. I have provided references for the proof.

(25) Provisos is correct.

(30) The constructions do not follow from [Kos78] or [Vog78]. They are just constructions that are used in various parts of the literature, and we are collecting and relating them to help readers navigate the literature.

(36) This is done 7 lines above the definition.

(41) I do not see the notation $G_x(\R)$ anywhere.
